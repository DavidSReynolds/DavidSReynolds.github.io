        <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of <em>The Weather Site</em> is to give current weather conditions in 3 different ways.
            The initial page will give the weather for the current location based on the Geocoding 
            location information from the device. The second is weather for 3 specific locations 
            accessible through a dedicated link, and the third is weather for any location determined
             by a search string.</p>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>Primary audience is adults ages 18-30. Most will be students. Access to the site will be 
           split between mobile devices and laptops. A secondary audience will be anyone interested in weather.</p>

        <h2>Audience Goals:</h2>
            <p>College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the weather conditions 
            for their current location as they head off to class or study. They are also often far from their 
            homes so the ability to quickly get the conditions for a specific location is important as well. 
            The third goal deals with planning for travels...the ability to get weather conditions for any 
            location will help with last minute packing for road trips.</p>

        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <img src="/image/cool-joe.jpg">
        <ul>
            <li>Name: Joe Cool</li>
            <li>Occupation: student</li>
            <li>Age: Eternally 18</li>
            <li>Interests: Traveling, Flying, Play acting, Eating</li>
            <li>Motivation: Joe is not into planning.  His last minute scrambling, 
                whether it is getting to class in the morning or heading out on his 
                latest adventure, has left him unprepared for weather conditions 
                many times (He is tired of sleeping in the rain and snow).  He 
                would like to be more prepared...without having to put much effort 
                into it...or planning.</li>
                <li>Environment:  Joe is comfortable using laptops and Mobile devices,
                    he will most often be found on a smart phone however.  Many of the 
                    places he frequents do not have great signalâ€¦he is often dealing 
                    with 3G speeds </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>All weather pages should include location name, current temperature, 
               forecast high, forecast low, current weather descriptor, forecast 
               percentage of precipitation, and current wind speed and direction on 
               small devices and hourly temps should be added on larger screens. The
               pages of the Weather Site will be built in the following order:</p>

         <h3>Page</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Franklin and Greenville weather for each specific location. The 
                weather for these pages should be pulled from the weather.JSON file 
                that will be provided.  </li>
            <li>Home: weather for the current location. Current location should 
                be determined by using the Geolocation API of the browser.  This 
                information should be passed to the WeatherUnderground API  
                (https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) to retrieve the current 
                conditions. </li>
            <li>3.	Search: Begins with only a search box, characters entered will 
                cause a list of suggested matches to appear.  Selected location will
                 pull up the weather. The search term from the field should be sent 
                 to the WeatherUnderground autocomplete API (https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=autocomplete-api&MR=1), 
                 and the results used to pull the current conditions for the selected location.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Styles</h3>
